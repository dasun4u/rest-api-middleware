## About DAPI REST API Middleware

This system is developed for Rest API service developers to manage their services. Anyone can download this application from GitHub and change according to their environments. All the users can log in to the system once it is hosted on a web server with PHP 7.0.0 or higher version. The application has been created by using Laravel 5.5 framework. The database has been created using Eloquent ORM. There are two user roles. Main user is admin user. Others are normal developer accounts. Therefore admin can change the database to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite or SQL server as he required. Admin can do all the administration functionalities by using back-end panel. They can create all the other developer accounts. Developer accounts need to be active before login. Developers need to register their services using backend panel. That services use in applications. This application must have the approval of the system admin. Middleware proxy works only for the registered RESTful API service calls. Logging facility provides for only user preferences.
